## Athletics
I started rowing for Capital Crew in high school as a shy, socially anxious freshman. I rowed in the top varsity boat starting my sophomore year and competed nationally ranking 6th and 9th in 2018 and 2019. I loved the sport so much and created some of the best friendships that I decided to continue into college. I was recruited into the newly transitioned Division I rowing program at UC San Diego. I again have competed in the top boat throughout my time here. This sport has taught me self-confidence and helpful skills such as time management, clear communication, and teamwork. It has also brought me some of my closest friendships and fondest memories. 

## Hobbies
I love backpacking during the summer. I enjoy traveling and have visited many countries. My most recent trips have been to the UK, where I was studying abroad in Edinburgh, and to Costa Rica and Belize with National Geographic Student Expeditions to complete community service and marine conservation projects. I am scuba certified and think our oceans are some of the most beautiful places in the world.
