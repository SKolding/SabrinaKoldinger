## Athletics
I have been a Division I rower for all four years of university. Prior I rowed all four years of high school at Capital Crew. Rowing has brought me some of my closest friendships and taught me many lessons. 

## Hobbies
I love backpacking during the summer. I enjoy traveling and have visited many countries. My most recent trips have been to the UK, where I was studying abroad in Edinburgh, and to Costa Rica and Belize with National Geographic Student Expeditions to complete community service and marine conservation projects.
